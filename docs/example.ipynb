    "Here we will demonstrate how to make use of the `financial_analyzer` package, a package produced to help users solve everyday financial problems related to their returns, accounting, and profits. This package contains four major functions, the `breakeven_point()` function for calculating ones business or service break even point, a `roi()` function for producing ones return on investment, a `units_for_target_profit()` for calculating how many units of your product you must sell to produced a desired profiit, and lastly a `plot_breakeven_point()` for graphing and visualizing the break even point, along with the revenue and cost lines. This package has the expectation to help business owners, enthusiasts of finance, and individuals preparing and completing interview questions."
