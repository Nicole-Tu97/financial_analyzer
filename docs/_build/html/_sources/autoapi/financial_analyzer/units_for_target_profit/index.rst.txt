   Context: You want to achieve a profit of $2,000 this month. Your fixed costs
   are $3,000, each unit is sold for $5, and the  variable cost is $2/unit.

   >>> fixed_costs = 3000
   >>> sales_price_per_unit = 5
   >>> variable_cost_per_unit = 2
   >>> desired_profit = 2000
   >>> units_to_sell = units_for_target_profit(fixed_costs,
                                                         sales_price_per_unit,
                                                         variable_cost_per_unit,
                                                         desired_profit)
   >>> print(units_to_sell)
   1000

   Output tells you how many units of the product must be sold to achieve desired profit
